1.Explain the difference between primitive and reference types of  data.


Primitive types store the actual value directly making them memory efficient and faster to access.
Reference types store memory addresses, enabling them reference complex objects.




2. Define scoope of a variable.


Local variable is declared inside a function and can be used only by statements inside the function.
Global variable is declared outside the functions or on top of a program.


3. Why is initialization of variables required.
 
The code is made more efficient since no temporary objects are created for the initialization.


4. Difference between static,instance and local variable.


Static variable is shared data across all the instance of a class.
Instance variable is for attributes specified to each object of a class.
Local variable is for temporary storage within methods.


5. Difference between widening and narrowing cast in java.


Widening cast safely converts smaller types to larger types.
Narrowing cast requires explicit conversion from larger to smaller types.




6. 


















7. Define class as used in OOP.


Is a program - code - template   for creating objects, providing initial values for states and implementing behaviours.


8. Explain the importance of classes in java programming.


It provides template for creating objects which can bind codes into data.






EXERCISE TWO.
1.Write a Java program that asks the user to enter their surname and current age then print the number of characters of their surname and even or odd depending on their age 


public class surnameage {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Scanner object for getting user input
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);


        // Ask the user to enter their surname
        System.out.print("Enter your surname: ");
        String surname = scanner.nextLine();


        // Ask the user to enter their current age
        System.out.print("Enter your current age: ");
        int age = scanner.nextInt();


        // Get the number of characters in the surname
        int surnameLength = surname.length();


        // Determine if the age is even or odd
        String ageType = (age % 2 == 0) ? "even" : "odd";


        // Print the results
        System.out.println("The number of characters in your surname is: " + surnameLength);
        System.out.println("Your age is " + ageType + ".");


        // Close the scanner
        scanner.close();
    }
}




2. Write a java program to ask students to enter the marks of the five units they did last semester,compute the average and display it on the screen ( Average should be given in two decimal places.)




public class studentmarks {


    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        double totalMarks = 0.0;


        // Loop to get marks for five units
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.print("Enter marks for Unit " + i + ": ");
            double marks = scanner.nextDouble();
            totalMarks += marks;
        }


        // Calculate and format average with two decimal places
        double average = Math.round(totalMarks / 5 * 100) / 100.0;


        System.out.println("The average marks for the five units is: " + average);


        scanner.close();
    }
}






3.Write a program that help kids learn divisibility test of numbers of integers.The program should check whether the given integer is divisible by integers in the range of 0- 9 .










public class divisibility {


    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);


        System.out.print("Enter an integer (0-9): ");
        int number = scanner.nextInt();


        // Validate input (0-9)
        if (number < 0 || number > 9) {
            System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter a number between 0 and 9.");
            return;
        }


        // Check divisibility for each digit (0-9)
        for (int divisor = 0; divisor <= 9; divisor++) {
            if (number % divisor == 0) {
                System.out.println(number + " is divisible by " + divisor);
            }
        }


        scanner.close();
    }
}
   


4.Write a program to display all the multiples of 2,3 and 7 within the range 71 to 150






public class multiplesinrange {


    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int start = 71;
        int end = 150;


        // Loop through numbers in the range
        for (int num = start; num <= end; num++) {
            // Check if the number is divisible by 2, 3, and 7
            if (num % 2 == 0 && num % 3 == 0 && num % 7 == 0) {
